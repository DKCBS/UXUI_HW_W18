            With a background in engineering, Diego is very experienced in understanding the root problems and finding efficient solutions to them.

            After completing some previous coding courses and dabbling with graphic design platforms before Diego wanted to find a balance of the two, so in 2020 Diego transitioned into a career of UX design. He feels UX design is a <b>great intersection of creative and analysis</b> work. There is so much room for creative expression but user experience design focuses on the user and <b>solutions to real human needs.</b>
